#review all countries of the world

A list of all the countries of the world is displayed on the app's home screen, while each row shows the foreign name and native name of a particular country.Â 
The user can choose whether to sort the list of countries by their foreign name, or by the size of their territory. By default, the list is sorted by the foreign name. 
When the user selects a country from the list, he is presented with all the countries bordering it.
